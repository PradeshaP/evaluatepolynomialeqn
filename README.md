Overview
This Java program allows users to input a polynomial's degree and its coefficients, then compute the value of the polynomial for a given variable \( x \). The program uses static methods and variables to handle input and computation.

 Features
- Input the degree of the polynomial.
- Input coefficients from the highest degree to the lowest.
- Compute the polynomial's value for a specified variable
